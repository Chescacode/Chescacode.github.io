                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>
                While I do like drawing and making art, I like music, too. One of the bands I listen to is BTS. BTS is a seven-member Korean boyband that debuted in 2013. Unlike the boybands in America, they incorporate a lot of dance into their music videos. Their music is mostly based on the struggles of life, growth as a person, and society's expectations; they also have the cliche love album, too. They have kind hearts and amazing personalities, along with great voices, too! For a guide to their MUSIC, and how it looked or listened like through out the years, go to this ---> <a class="linky" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Km0beyc0mes">Link</a> <---. The video bellow is one of their recent music videos. This is a remix version of their song Mic Drop from the Love Yourself: Her album with Steve Aoki. They made another version of Mic Drop with Desiigner, a known rapper. Although there is no music video with the Desiigner version, it is available on itunes, spotify, and you can find the audio on Youtube. There's also a Japanese version. In a nutshell, Mic Drop has 4 versions: the Original (in Korean), Japanese, Steve Aoki (English and Korean), Steve Aoki and Desiigner (English and Korean). Watch the video with CC on.
